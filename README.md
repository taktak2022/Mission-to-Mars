## Overview
This module covers Web-Scraping, a process to extract information from active websites.  The gathered data is then placed in a properly formatted webpage.  The best part is that this webpage can be automated to gather the most current information from those active websites.

We will be assisting Robin, a junior data scientist who moonlights (space pun intended) as a freelance astronomer in her spare time.  She has an idea after spending most of her free time visiting sites about space exploration, focusing on the Mission to Mars as her dream job would be to work for NASA someday.  To further this interest, she decides to create a webpage on her favorite subject which, if polished can shine enough to get the attention of the staff at NASA.
